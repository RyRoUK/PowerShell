         Installs a certificate chain on the end-entity computer.

             in this case is the $CSR since the request started with $Enroll back in CreateRequest().
             Remember in here we are using the DER-encoded Response and not the request.
            +Encoding = An EncodingType Enumeration value that specifies the type of encoding applied to the string.
             EncodingTpe was shown above and in this case, the script is choosing Enumeration Value 1 since it was encoded by the type of unicode encoding Base64

             It there is a password, clear it from memory when you have finished.
        -CreatePFX
         This method creates a Personal Information Exchange(PFX) message.
         The message is contained in a byte array that is encoded by using DER as defined by ASN.1 standard
         The DER-encoded byte array is represented by a string that is either a pure binary sequence or is Unicode encoded.

             This can be NULL to indicate that no password is isued.
            +ExportOptions = Expects an Enumeration Value that specifies how much of the certificate chain is exported.
             You can export the certificate only, the certificate chain without the root, or the entire chain.
                *PFXExportEEOnly         = 0, / includes only the end entity certificate

                *PFXExportChainWithRoot  = 2 /Includes the entire certificate chain.
            +Encoding = expects an enumeration value. By default this is XCN_CRYPT_STRING_BASE64. which is 1
            +pValue = Pointer to a BSTR variable that contains the DER-Encoded PFX Message
            In this case the last $Enroll
         The PFX format is also known as PKCS #12. The CreatePFX method:
            +Opens the certificate store in memory for the default provider.
            +Adds the installed certificate to the store or builds the certificate chain adds a link to it.
            +Exports the certificate and the private key to a PFX message depending on the export options specified.
